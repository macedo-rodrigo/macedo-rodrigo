ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m Rodrigo, a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a Master's degree in Full Stack Web Development from The Valley Business School in Spain. I'm on the lookout for my first opportunity in the tech industry.

With 3 years of hands-on experience in Python, I've built a strong back-end foundation and am now diving into Java to further broaden my skill set. I'm eager to continuously learn and adapt to new programming languages and technologies to stay ahead in this dynamic field.

I'm multilingual, speaking Portuguese, English, Spanish, and a touch of French, which allows me to connect and collaborate with a diverse range of people.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! You can reach me via email at rodrigoalvesdemacedo@live.com.
