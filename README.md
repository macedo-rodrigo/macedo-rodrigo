ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m Rodrigo, a Junior Front End Web Developer currently enrolled in a Master's program in Full Stack Web Development at The Valley Business School in Spain. I'm also looking for my first job opportunity.

I'm focused on honing my skills in ReactJS for front-end development and delving deeper into Node.js for back-end development. Feel free to explore my projects!

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at rodrigoalvesdemacedo@live.com or find me on Discord as @rodri_36957.
